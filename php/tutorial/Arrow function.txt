Arrow functions are supposed to be a more concise version of anonymous functions. Arrow functions can be seen as shorthand functions that automatically inherit the parent scopeâ€™s variables. This is an advantage arrow functions have over regular functions and even anonymous functions.

$ar = fn($a,$b)=>$a+$b;
echo $ar(2,3);

Another example:
$me = "Hello";
$ar = fn($name)=>$me.$name;
echo $ar('Saiful');  //output:Hello saiful
