$name = $_POST['name'] ?? 'John';

In this example, the ?? is the null coalescing operator. It accepts two operands. If the first operand is null or doesnâ€™t exist, the null coalescing operator returns the second operand. Otherwise, it returns the first one.

*It is used to replace the ternary operation in conjunction with isset() function.
