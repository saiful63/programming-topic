The Laravel bootstrapping process is the process of loading and initializing the Laravel framework and application. It begins when a request is received by the Laravel server. The following steps are involved in the Laravel bootstrapping process:

The autoload.php file is loaded, which includes the Composer autoloader. This allows Laravel to load any packages that have been installed using Composer.

The services.php file is loaded, which registers all of the service providers that are used by the application. Service providers are responsible for registering various components in the Laravel service container.

The app.php file is loaded, which bootstraps the Laravel application. This includes creating the Laravel service container, loading the kernel class, and booting the service providers.

The kernel class loads the middleware that is registered for the application. Middleware is responsible for handling requests before they reach the application's controllers.

The kernel class then dispatches the request to the appropriate controller.
Once the request has been dispatched to the controller, the Laravel bootstrapping process is complete. The controller is then responsible for handling the request and generating a response.

Here is a simplified diagram of the Laravel bootstrapping process:

[Request received]
|
|-> autoload.php (load Composer autoloader)
|
|-> services.php (register service providers)
|
|-> app.php (bootstrap the Laravel application)
|
|-> kernel class (load middleware and dispatch request)
|
|-> controller (handle request and generate response)
