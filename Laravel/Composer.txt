*Composer is package manager for  php environment.
As a example of spatie package,laravel is dependant on it.So composer install it to laravel project.Not only install,it can update version if new version available.

->composer init:Creating composer file that represent we are going start working with composer in this project
->composer install:if modify something in composer and run it there then change is added

*Another cool thing that composer can do is autoloading  facility.Autoloading means using different file into one file for operation that usually performed by spl_autoload_register() or require_once() in raw php.it is acheived through autoload keyword.

 "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/",
            "Database\\Seeders\\": "database/seeders/"
        }
    }
    
Here,psr-4 is that represent   standard that is used by php popular framework , how they load different file.
