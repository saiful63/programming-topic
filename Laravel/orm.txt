*Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the bridge between databases and object-oriented programming.

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique used to map objects in an object-oriented programming language to relational database tables. ORM frameworks provide a way to interact with databases using objects, making it easier to perform database operations without writing raw SQL queries.As a example a object have id,name and reated column have in DB table,orm come and take object data and databse operation with developer friendly without interaction of sql query.

1.The Object part is the one you use with your programming language ( python in this case )

2.The Relational part is a Relational Database Manager System ( A database that is ) there are other types of databases but the most popular is relational ( you know tables, columns, pk fk etc eg Oracle MySQL, MS-SQL )

3.And finally the Mapping part is where you do a bridge between your objects and your tables.
