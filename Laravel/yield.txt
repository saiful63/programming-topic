*Yield is a function used in Laravel to define a particular section in layout and it is permanently used to retrieve content from the child page and transfer it into the master page.

*The difference between @yield and @include is how you use them.

If you have a static kind of content, like a navbar, this part of the page will always be in the same place in the layout. When you use @include in the layout file, the navbar will be put once per layout. But if you use @yield you will be enforced to make a @section of the navbar on every page that @extends the layout.

@yield is, on the other hand, a better choice when content is changing on all the pages but you still want to use the same layout everywhere. If you use @include you'll have to make a new layout for every page, because of the difference of content.

Example:
1.Navbar is static content ,to reuse navbar in different pages ,using @include() in beneficial.
2.On the other hand a file which contain html head ,title,body with bootstrap cdn that will change differently according to the purpose and in this situatuation @yield() is beneficial.

#home.blade.php:

<html>
<body>

@yield('content');

</body>
</html>

#registration.blade.php
@extends('home')

@section('content)

@endsection('content');

#login.blade.php
@extends('home')

@section('content)

@endsection('content');

here you can registration and login code will be diiferent but using home.blade.php through @yield();

*Summary:
through yield we can specify section  that act differently.
