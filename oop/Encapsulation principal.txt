*Encapsulation what varies,Codes which change frequently that should be encapsulate differently .

function Totalprice(){
$price = 40;
$amount = 4;
$gen_price=$price * $amount;
//Frequently changing code block
if(country == 'usa) price+=20;
else if(country == 'EU') price=+10;


},This codes doesn't follow this principal because different country can add frequently then we need to  change this portion frequently in  TotalPrice() but other portion remain static.

To solve this ,adding two function is desirable to encapsulate them differently.

function ProduvctPrice()
{

$price = 40;
$amount = 4;
$gen_price=$price * $amount;

}


function PriceWithTax(){

//Frequently changing code block
if(country == 'usa) price+=20;
else if(country == 'EU') price=+10;
}
