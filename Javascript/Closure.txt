A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

function temporary(){
    let counter = 0;

    return function(){  //This function is clousure that can access counter variable of parent functions temporary.
        counter+=1;
    }
}

const add = temporary();

console.dir(add)
add();
add();
add();  //Output: counter=3

Here temporary function is callled ones but value of counter is 3 for using of closure.

Data Encapsulation and Information Hiding: Closures allow you to create private variables and functions within a scope. This helps in encapsulating data and exposing only the necessary parts, making it useful for implementing data privacy and information hiding.
