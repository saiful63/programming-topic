WE can develop functionality according to our own.There are sequence in development process that specify one task will execute earlier another will execute later.Through call back we can do it easily.


const takeOrder = (customer,callback)=>{
    console.log(`Taking order from ${customer}`);
    callback(customer);
}

const processOrder = (customer,callback)=>{
    console.log(`Order processing of ${customer}`);
    setTimeout(()=>{
       console.log(`Cooking..`);
       console.log(`Cooking completed for ${customer}`);
       callback(customer);
    },3000);
}

const completeOrder = (customer)=>{
   console.log(`Order completed for ${customer}`); 
}

takeOrder('Customer 2',(customer)=>{
    processOrder(customer,(customer)=>{
      completeOrder(customer);
    });
});

Output:
Taking order from customer1
Order processing of customer1
Cooking..
Cooking completed for customer1
Order completed for customer1
